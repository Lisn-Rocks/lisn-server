# Lisn Front End

This is just the Front End part for the Lisn Music Streaming service.



## Get Started

There isn't much you need to do to get started with the client side. Just `cd`
into the `Lisn/client` folder and run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

It will install all the dependencies for you. The `vue.js` file is already here,
you can find it in the `Lisn/client/js` folder.



## Serve or Build

These commands will help you:

```bash
npm run serve   # to compile stuff on the go and serve it straight away

npm run build   # to build for development
```

Make sure to check with `Lisn/README.md` file before building for development!
There are some important things to be done.
